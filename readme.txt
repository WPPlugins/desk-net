Connect your WordPress site with Desk-Net, the editorial calendar tool for medium to large editorial teams and content marketers.

== Description ==

Are you using the editorial calendar software Desk-Net to plan your stories and to manage your editorial department?

This plugin connects your Desk-Net account to one or multiple WordPress sites. Your story lists and related meta-data such as statuses are synced both ways between the two systems.

Two main use-cases are supported:

* **Planned content**: A post is planned and enriched with meta-data in Desk-Net. Based on this Desk-Net automatically creates a post in WordPress. Subsequent changes in either system are synced instantly.
* **Breaking news**: A story originates as a post in WordPress. The plugin sends relevant data to Desk-Net ensuring the story lists are complete.


The following meta-data is synced:

* Post description
* Publishing date and time
* Statuses
* Categories
* Author emails
* URLs of either system

Please note that you need to have an account in Desk-Net to make use of the plugin.
